After re-activating this blog for the 3rd or 4th time; I now remember why it goes neglected quite a lot.

It's mainly due to the fact that I'm fairly difficult to actually enrage about a subject. Don't get me wrong, within my friend group I have a reputation for playing devil's advocate and probably for being fairly belligerent. But in order to write a big ranting paragraph, and for it actually to have enough substance to meet the incredibly low standards to be posted, I have to be angry enough, or at the very least feel like I am making a passionate or unique point to find the motivation to bother.

Although, hypocritically, obviously it happens fairly regularly, as the majority of posts on this site are tagged in the rant category. Although with the reasonably low number of posts over the span of years, I'm not going to be booking myself in for a blood pressure check just yet.

I also don't consider myself enough of an expert to write reviews on anything or well-connected enough to provide meaningful or valuable updates on anything in particular, so that's those particular content streams out the window.

I also realise 9 times out of 10 I am writing to nobody, except maybe 1 or 2 people; or to the contrary the rest of the time I wouldn't want to publish it on the internet in case other people found it. So I don't feel particularly pressured by my audience, or lack here-in thereof.

This tends to leave me in somewhat of a "writer's block" situation with nothing to write about. Maybe that's not a bad thing, and as much as this post may sound otherwise, I'm not even bitter about it. It means my website stays full of things I'm passionate about and as it's exactly that, my website, I'm quite happy with that.

So today, you just get this filler paragraph about creating content. Maybe next time you might get something worth reading.

Sorry for wasting your time. Somehow I seem to have written a passionate post about not being passionate
