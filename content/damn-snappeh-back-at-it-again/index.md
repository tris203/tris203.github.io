This blog once again has a new home with the same old content

This time I have hosted it on my own environment, so it should be here for as long as my server lasts. Unless I have some sort of terrible hardware failure

I've probably jinxed it now.

A lot has happened in the 7 years since I last posted on a tech front and a personal level. Maybe there will be some posts about it, maybe not.

I should try to get back into writing again, writing is a massage for the soul.
