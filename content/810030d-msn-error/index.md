As I mentioned in the first post of this install, this blog has been installed and reinstalled lots of times.

However, one page that always keeps coming up my logs as 404's is requests for this page. I must get about 20-30 links to this page a week. Well not this exact post, but to the content that used to be here. So here is that content, recreated, sort of. This was a post I wrote about two years ago on fixing the 810030D error message from Windows Live Messenger.

Turns out the error was to do with ZoneAlarm firewall. I can't remember the exact resolution, and I don't have access to backups from that version of the blog to check.

But it was either allowing the executable associated with Messenger, or an option deep down somewhere. Have a poke around you'll find it.

Thank you, Goodnight.
