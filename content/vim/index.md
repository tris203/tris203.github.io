# To Vim Or Not To Vim
For a long time I have enviously looked at people whizzing around in Vim and always been envious. Although I will be honest, whenever I am faced with a terminal nano is my go to. Embarrassing, I know but it is the truth. One of the reasons I reached for nano was from my first Linux experience 15 years ago, and probably from opening Vi and not knowing how to exit. I was the meme.

I have for a while now though been watching various people stream development and the speed at which people wizz round in vim is stunning, and it just makes coding look more eloquent. Like a dance, which I like. If you are going to spend as much time in an editor as you have to as a programmer, you might as well make it fun!

## Where I Was Before

VsCode was always my go to, I liked it, it worked and with a nice set of Extensions it functioned well. However, since moving to Linux for all of my home developements, I had fallen in love with working without the mouse as much as possible. Having a nice tiling window editor was the start but I felt like my development workflow still left much to be desired. I was fairly familiar with all the commands I needed to close windows, move windows, search files, but the main issue was the file tree. I just couldn't find a a nice solution that felt *right*. 

## What I Found

From watching various streamers, including Prime. KIckstart for Vim kept getting recommended.
