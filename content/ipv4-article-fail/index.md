I know that Jason was going to cover this on his blog over at [deedoubleyou.net](http://deedoubleyou.net), but he hasn’t. And this was posted on the 4th of February, back when the IPV4 exhaustion thing was current. So I thought I would write a little something about this before it's entirely outdated.

Everybody knows we are running out of IPV4 addresses, and has read about it on about a million technical sites. Well, our local paper decided to do a small section about it in its 'world news' section.

As an IT Professional/Technical person, reading this explanation was painful, to say the least. Now, I know they are writing for a non-technical audience, but a small attempt for some sort of accuracy would have been nice.

So without further ado, look after the break for a copy of the article, and my points after reading it.

Oh, and Guernsey Press, keep away from technical writing for a bit please ![Guernsey Press IPV4 article - 4/2/11](/images/GPArticle.jpg) Please read through the article, on the bits that I have highlighted. You should be able to click on it, to get it full size. Then each of these numbered points below addresses my comments on that highlighted part.

## Fail 1 - Web Address

Web addresses: [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_address) We are running out of IP addresses, not Web addresses, I’m pretty sure every perceivable domain, on every single TLD isn’t about to be taken.

## Fail 2 - Internet Numbers

Internet numbers is a fail, I'm pretty sure somebody with even a basic idea of networking could explain it better than that. An internet address would have been better, or an internet postcode. That would have made a lot more sense. Also, 192.168.1.1 isn’t an internet address, as it is reserved for internal use. So I wouldn’t call it an internet number/postcode at all.

## Fail 3 - Wrong number

The number of addresses is actually 2^32, which is more like 4,294,967,296. Unless they have taken out broadcast addresses etc, although judging by the standard of the rest of the article, I doubt they would know what they were.

## Fail 4 - Lying

(<http://ipv6-test.com/validate.php>) - if you run that on channelisles.net, then it fails all tests and says that even their website isn’t IPv6 ready.

## Fail 5 - NATing exists

Fridges and cookers would be behind your router; unless you have 4,000,000,000 devices connected to your personal LAN, it isn’t going to be an issue. NATing, it works bitches.

## Fail 6 - More Lies

IPs aren’t necessarily unique, especially ones connected to private numbers. Please don’t set your router’s IP to 192.168.0.1, that’s one I use for mine! You’ll break the Internets!

## Conclusion

Well, kids, this is why technical writing should be limited to technical people. Another point I would like to make is if you are 'dumbing' down a technical subject, for a non-technical audience, please keep it accurate. There is no point in misinformation.

So in final conclusion: 6 technical fails in a few hundred words is pretty appalling, although it did give me and the rest of the IT team at work some laughs. Well played Guernsey Press.
