Well this is the 3rd WordPress installation at this URL.

Hopefully ill be able to go to the hard drive of azaroth (my old server) and be able to pull the old content off that.

Until then; thanks to Jason ([deedoubleyou](http://deedoubleyou.net)) for hosting this on the VPS for his new company [Reformsoft](http://reformsoft.org).

So, this is just filler. But real content is on its way soon, maybe, if I'm not too lazy.
