According to the BBC "[Online gaming forums have also been buzzing with accounts of consoles showing the Red Ring of Death shortly after plugging in Kinects.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12121999)"

It is well known that the RROD is usually caused by overheating your GPU. Does the Kinect work the GPU more than say COD or other graphically intense games? Or is it just coincidence that the hours and hours everybody is spending playing with the new Kinect they got for Christmas is causing overheating from prolonged use. Microsoft says neither, and â€œAny new instances of the three flashing red lights error are merely coincidental"
