My parents are looking at getting a new car. They have always liked Fords. The other day I was writing to a friend and decided to update him on my thought on their current thoughts. A Ford Focus CC. I made a small PDF review to send to him, which can be found below. You may get the jist from the review, but Iâ€™m really not a fan of them. But without further a do here it is, you may find it funny, you may not. Probably not.  [Ford Focus CC Review](http://snappeh.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/FocusCC.pdf)
